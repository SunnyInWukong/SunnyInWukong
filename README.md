## About Me
Iâ€™m **Brett Knox**, a Data Science student at the **University of North Florida**, graduating **Spring 2026**.  

I founded and manage **A.R.C.** (*Applied Research Collective*), a workshop where S.T.E.M. students apply classroom knowledge to real-world projects.  

My academic focus is **data science**, but my personal work spans **engineering, electronics, and robotics**â€”driven by a passion for building, experimenting, and applying knowledge in practical ways.

## Projects

### Networking & Systems
- [**Iterative Socket Server**](https://github.com/SunnyInWukong/Iterative_Socket_Server)  
- [**Concurrent Socket Server**](https://github.com/SunnyInWukong/Concurrent-Socket-Server)  

Java-based client-server programs. Explored iterative vs. concurrent architectures, performance scaling, and turnaround time analysis under increasing load.

### Electronics & Robotics
- **Business Card Thrower**  
  3D-printed, wrist-mounted launcher that feeds cards via spring-loaded holder into a motorized spinner.  
  Designed and printed custom models, wired circuits, and integrated a button trigger for one-handed use.  
  Also developed an ESP32 + transistor Bluetooth-controlled version, but optimized final design for standalone button control.  
  *Planned additions*: STL files, wiring diagrams, and demo video.
- **Bluetooth Door Closer**  
  ESP32 + DC motor device that spools cord to automatically close a door via Bluetooth commands.  
  *Planned additions*: circuit diagrams, build photos, and optional demo video.

- **Pull-Chain Sound Button**  
  MP3 module with push-button interface for sound playback, extended with ESP32 for playback control.  
  *Planned additions*: wiring diagrams, build documentation, and optional demo video.

### Fundamentals & Practice
- [**Python Practice (Data Structures & Algorithms)**](https://github.com/SunnyInWukong/Python-Practice)  
  A collection of Python implementations for linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and traversal methods.  
  Focused on algorithmic efficiency, memory use, and clean reusable code.  
  *Planned additions*: sorting/searching algorithms, recursion, and complexity notes.
