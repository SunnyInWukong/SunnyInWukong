## About Me
I’m **Brett Knox**, a Data Science student at the **University of North Florida**, graduating **Spring 2026**.  

I founded and manage **A.R.C.** (*Applied Research Collective*), a workshop where S.T.E.M. students apply classroom knowledge to real-world projects.  

My academic focus is **data science**, but my personal work spans **engineering, electronics, and robotics**—driven by a passion for building, experimenting, and applying knowledge in practical ways.
